# Quantikz Tutorial - A Quantum Circuit Typesetting Tool for LaTeX

Welcome to the **Quantikz** tutorial repository, designed to help you create elegant quantum circuit diagrams with LaTeX and the `Quantikz` package. This guide offers installation instructions, usage examples, and detailed explanations of Quantikz's features.

Quantikz is a `TikZ`-based library that provides a more intuitive and customizable alternative to `QCircuit` for typesetting quantum circuits in LaTeX.

This tutorial summarizes Alastair Kay's paper, "Tutorial on the Quantikz Package," and includes examples and tips for effective use of the package.

## Overview

Quantikz is a TikZ library designed for typesetting quantum circuits. It allows users to create diagrams in a matrix-like structure, enabling easy manipulation of quantum and classical wires, gates, and measurements.


## Introduction

**Quantikz** is a LaTeX package built on top of `TikZ`, designed specifically for typesetting quantum circuits. It serves as a modern alternative to `QCircuit`, with a simpler and more intuitive syntax. Whether you're new to quantum computing or a seasoned researcher, Quantikz allows you to create professional, publication-quality quantum circuits with ease.


### Key Advantages:

- **Quantum and Classical Wires**: Support for quantum, classical, and bundled wires.
- **Customizable Gates**: Create a wide variety of gates, including single-qubit gates, multi-qubit gates, and controlled gates.
- **Highlighting and Slicing**: Easily highlight parts of your circuit and slice it for step-by-step explanations.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Quantikz offers features to convert from `QCircuit` and remains backward-compatible with older versions.

## Installation

To use Quantikz, ensure that your LaTeX distribution includes the `Quantikz` package. Most current TeX distributions should have it available. In your LaTeX document, include the following in the preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{quantikz2}
```

If you're uploading to arXiv, you may need to manually include the Quantikz file by adding tikzlibraryquantikz2.code.tex to your project.

Basic Usage
Quantum Wires
In Quantikz, quantum circuits are organized in a matrix-like format. Each column is separated by &, and new rows are created with \\. By default, all wires are quantum wires.

```latex
\begin{quantikz}
& \gate{H} & \ctrl{1} & \gate{X} & \meter{} \\
& \targ{}  & \ctrl{-1} & \gate{H} & \meter{}
\end{quantikz}
```

This creates a basic quantum circuit with Hadamard (H), controlled gate (ctrl), Pauli-X (X), and measurement gates.

Gates and Measurement
Use the \gate command to add gates. You can also add measurement gates (\meter) and phase gates (\phase):

```latex
\begin{quantikz}
& \gate{H} & \gate[2]{U} & \gate{R_Z(\theta)} & \meter{} \\
& & & \phase{\alpha} &
\end{quantikz}
Controlled Gates
For controlled gates, use the \ctrl and \targ commands. Here's an example of a controlled gate and a swap gate:
```

```latex
\begin{quantikz}
& \ctrl{1} & \targ{} & \swap{1} & \ctrl[vertical wire=c]{2} & \\
& \control{} & \ctrl[open]{-1} & \targX{} & \gate{X} & \\
&&&& \gate{U} & \meter{} \wire[u][1]{c}
\end{quantikz}
```
